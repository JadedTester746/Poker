This is my version of a 5 card poker game. As of right now, the game lets you choose a number of AI's to play against that each have the ability to analayze their cards and swap for the optimal hand. Theres also a round of betting where the AI will dynamically raise, call or fold. In the future I intend to clean the code, and make both the card swapping and betting more advanced.
